Within Amazon CloudWatch Logs, create a metric filter and alarm off the number of HTTP 403 responses. Create an alarm when the number of messages exceeds a threshold set by the Security team.
    - [ ] B. Ensure that no CIDR ranges are overlapping, and attach a virtual private gateway (VGW) to each Provision an IPsec tunnel between each VGW and enable route propagation on the route table. Configure security groups on each service to allow the CIDR ranges of the VPCs on the other accounts. Enable VPC Flow Logs and use an Amazon CloudWatch Logs subscription filter for rejected traffic. Create an IAM role and allow the Security team to call the AssumeRole action for each account.
    - [ ] C. Deploy a transit VPC by using third-party marketplace VPN appliances running on Amazon EC2, dynamically routed VPN connections between the VPN appliance, and the virtual private gateways (VGWs) attached to each VPC within the region. Adjust network ACLs to allow traffic from the local VPC only. Apply security groups to the microservices to allow traffic from the VPN appliances only. Install the awslogs agent on each VPN appliance and configure logs to forward to Amazon CloudWatch Logs in the security account for the Security team to access.
    - [ ] D. Create a Network Load Balancer (NLB) for each microservice. Attach the NLB to a PrivateLink endpoint service and whitelist the accounts that will be consuming this service. Create an interface endpoint in the consumer VPC and associate a security group that allows only the security group IDs of the services authorized to call the producer service. On the producer services, create security groups for each microservice and allow only the CIDR range the allowed services. Create VPC Flow Logs on each VPC to capture rejected traffic that will be delivered to an Amazon CloudWatch Logs group. Create a CloudWatch Logs subscription that streams the log data to a security account.

35. An organization has a write-intensive mobile application that uses Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, and Amazon DynamoDB. The application has scaled well, however, costs have increased exponentially because of higher than anticipated Lambda costs. The application's use is unpredictable, but there has been a steady 20% increase in utilization every month. While monitoring the current Lambda functions, the Solutions Architect notices that the execution time averages 4.5 minutes. Most of the wait time is the result of a high-latency network call to a 3TB MySQL database server that is on-premises. A VPN is used to connect to the VPC, so the Lambda functions have been configured with a five-minute timeout. How can the Solutions Architect reduce the cost of the current architecture?
    - [ ] A. Replace the with AWS Direct Connect to reduce the network latency to the on-premises MySQL database. Enable local caching in the mobile application to reduce the Lambda function invocation calls. Monitor the Lambda function performance; gradually adjust the timeout and memory properties to lower values while maintaining an acceptable execution time. Offload the frequently accessed records from DynamoDB to Amazon ElastiCache.

36. A company runs a video processing platform. Files are uploaded by users who connect to a web server, which stores them on an Amazon EFS share. This web server is running on a single Amazon EC2 instance. A different group of instances, running in an Auto Scaling group, scans the EFS share directory structure for new files to process and generates new videos (thumbnails, different resolution, compression, etc.) according to the instructions file, which is uploaded along with the video files. A different application running on a group of instances managed by an Auto Scaling group processes the video files and then deletes them from the EFS share. The results are stored in an S3 bucket. Links to the processed video files are emailed to the customer. The company has recently discovered that as they add more instances to the Auto Scaling Group, many files are processed twice, so image processing speed is not improved. The maximum size of these video files is 2GB. What should the Solutions Architect do to improve reliability and reduce the redundant processing of video files?
    - [ ] A. Modify the web application to upload the video files directly to Amazon S3. Use Amazon CloudWatch Events to trigger an AWS Lambda function every time a file is uploaded and have this Lambda function put a message into an Amazon queue for new files and use the queue depth metric to scale instances in the video processing Auto Scaling group.
    - [ ] B. Set up a cron job on the web server instance to synchronize the contents of the EFS share into Amazon S3. Trigger an AWS Lambda function every time a file is uploaded to process the video file and store the results in Amazon S3. Using Amazon CloudWatch Events trigger an Amazon SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.
    - [ ] C. Rewrite the web application to run directly from Amazon S3 and use Amazon API Gateway to upload the video files to an S3 bucket. Use an S3 trigger to run an AWS Lambda function each time a file is uploaded to process and store new video files in a different bucket. Using CloudWatch Events, trigger an SES job to send an email to the customer containing the link to the processed file.
    - [ ] D. Rewrite the application to run from Amazon S3 and upload the video files to an S3 bucket. Each time a new file is uploaded, trigger an AWS Lambda function to put a message in an SQS queue containing the link and the instructions. Modify the video processing application to read from the SQS queue and the S3 bucket. Use the queue depth metric to adjust the size of the Auto Scaling group for video processing instances.

For example, the VPC ID, subnet IDs, and security groups from the network stack may need to be used in the application stack or database stack Which actions will help reduce the operation burden and the number of parameters passed into a service deployment? (Choose two.)
    - [ ] A. Create a new AWS CloudFormation template for each service. After the existing templates to use cross-stack references to eliminate passing many parameters to each template. Call each required stack for the application as a nested stack from the new stack. Call the newly created service stack from the AWS CloudFormation console to deploy the specific service with a subset of the parameters previously required.
    - [ ] B. Create a new portfolio in AWS Service Catalog for each service. Create a product for each existing AWS CloudFormation template required to build the service. Add the products to the portfolio that represents that service in AWS Service Catalog. To deploy the service, select the specific service portfolio and launch the portfolio with the necessary parameters to deploy all templates.
    - [ ] C. Set up an AWS CodePipeline workflow for each service. For each existing template, choose AWS CloudFormation as a deployment action. Add the AWS CloudFormation template to the deployment action. Ensure that the deployment actions are processed to make sure that dependences are obeyed. Use configuration files and scripts to share parameters between the stacks. To launch the service, execute the specific template by choosing the name of the service and releasing a change.
    - [ ] D. Use AWS Step Functions to define a new service. Create a new AWS CloudFormation template for each service. After the existing templates to use cross-stack references to eliminate passing many parameters to each template. Call each required stack for the application as a nested stack from the new service template. Configure AWS Step Functions to call the service template directly. In the AWS Step Functions console, execute the step.
    - [ ] E. Create a new portfolio for the Services in AWS Service Catalog. Create a new AWS CloudFormation template for each service. After the existing templates to use cross-stack references to eliminate passing many parameters to each template. Call each required stack for the application as a nested stack from the new stack. Create a product for each application. Add the service template to the product. Add each new product to the portfolio. Deploy the product from the portfolio to deploy the service with the necessary parameters only to start the deployment.
